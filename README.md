## My Resume

My Resume. Template borrowed from [deedy](https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume). Thank you to [deedy](https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume) for this useful and beautiful template!
A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume template.

## Motivation

This template perfectly meets my expectations. It is very **sober**, allows **detail**, be a **single page**, and allows useful **LaTeX templating**.
